# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
    My intitial thoughts about the python programming language is that it is harder than the java langauge, but I believe this is because when i was learning java I knew more but now that I lost that knowledge I am confused, but I like how you don't have to use semi colons or define the variable. 


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
    Some differences between java and python is that you don't have to use semi colons and define variables in python. A similarity is that functions and arrays are the same.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
    Something I learned through this assignment is how to make a code give me every ther function in an array
